0,mM8i91yWP1QbImEvz5ds0w,"In the heart of Chinatown, I discovered it enroute to Kensington Market one day. It's quite hard to see, if you don't know it's there. First experience was very positive - would definitely return!

ATMOSPHERE: Small space. Think Banh Mi Boys, and other trendy over-the-counter eateries. Vibe is casual. Free WiFi is nice.

SERVICE: Okay. Staff does their job, but not overly helpful upon entering the space. Maybe because it's an over-the-counter style place, but it would have been nice to be walked through their ordering process and menu.

PRICE: Average. Depends on the size of pizza you order.The small pizza ($7-9.50) is filling for one. Large size pizza ($13-18.50) is good for sharing... or one VERY hungry person.  Pasta portions are very generous for the price tag ($9-14)


FOOD: My friends and I were here for the first time, and we thought it was a pizza place so we all ordered pizza. It wasn't until we were waiting for the food to come, that we looked around and realised EVERY other table around us only had pasta on them. Guess we gotta come back to try! We did notice that the menu said their pasta is homemade. So will definitely come back.

Here's the pizza we ordered:

Peking Duck Pizza - Very tasty! Rich flavours that work well. But it's heavy, so come hungry - or order to share.

Margherita - Good, but not the best. I recommend trying the more ""special"" toppings instead.

Shall return, and/or try other locations.","(very tasty, peking duck pizza), (good but not the best, margherita), (filling for one, small pizza), (good for sharing, large size pizza)"

2,EWQheKuBEQ6b5hxOiMpwag,"Really nice, casual bistro feel.  Quick and easy spot for a light lunch.  Food could be improved.

The shrimp and avocado appetizer could be improved upon - the shrimp was very fresh but it lacked flavor.

The grilled octopus was delicious - nicely charred and savory with the chickpeas and tomato sauce.

The pizza with mushrooms also could be improved upon - the crusty was undercooked and had none of that nice, smoky flavor it should have.
The mushroom pasta looked really good - lots of mixed mushrooms and very moist.","(could be improved upon, pizza with mushrooms)"
3,CKHk7l_VriSEqPbG1PSLTw,"There is a large dine-in area that is child friendly with arcade games. The pretezel bites were awesome, hot and soft. The seafood salad was fair. The use imitation crab meat in a creamy base, similar to Neptune salad. My husband enjoyed his pizza, but Angelos in Lakewood is still his favorite. The lady at the counter who took our order was very friendly and helpful. She explained the specials and talked to my husband about their Cruisin' nights.","(enjoyed, pizza)"
4,0663Q4JmeVKV4TXraWKtGg,"This is really a hidden gem in Richmond Hill. My girlfriend and I were craving pasta tonight, so we resorted to Yelp and found this place in the nearby. We ordered the Penne Al Vodka and the Baked Lasagna take-out.

When I got to the place, I was a little skeptical as there werent any customers. The place looked cozy and comfortable though! Got the food and brought it home. Had a taste and we were extremely impressed. This is a true definition of ""You can't judge a book by it's cover"". The food tasted fresh and homemade. I was so relieved that I didn't see a lot of steam when I opened the box, as that usually means the food was microwaved. 

I will say though, the online menu prices are outdated. The actual prices are a little more expensive (at least for the lasagna).

Can't wait to try this place again.",

8,ASu3k4qKyMMJkF9m-MwI6w,"This was my second time in the last few months meeting a friend for lunch at
Luciano Garden Restaurant.  It is not far from my home.  The restaurant was perfect for conversation, and very comfortable.  The pizza is the best pizza I have had in a long time in the Las Vegas area.  The chopped salad was a generous portion with a lovely light dressing.  I plan to have dinner with my husband in the near future and am looking forward to trying some of their seafood, pasta dishes.",(best pizza)
9,wDhGhq0GHnCTjaoJAZsTjA,Great Service. The food was good. The lasagna was a little too spicy for me. I want to try their pizza next. Parking was crazy and long wait times are negative factors.,"(a little too spicy, lasagna)"

11,RaWCnJ8B-0qeZdU64_D-TQ,"You should not go unless you have a reservation. We went unplanned b/c we were in the area. And granted it's a nice basement, but you kind of feel second class getting relegated to the basement. Sitting next to a flat screen playing college basketball doesn't scream fine dining. But maybe that's my fault b/c the rest of this review is positive. Our food was cooked very well. Great flavors and selection (meatless friendly options, etc.). I had the delicious sea scallops in lobster sauce (I only got three though). I think I would have preferred traditional gnocchi as opposed to the semolina, they were a bit doughy. But they did soak up the sauce well, so maybe that's why, obviously Zack Bruell knows more than I do. My wife liked her risotto. The service was professional. But for the price there are better Italian options not far away.","(doughy, gnocchi)"
12,BZgBVx89YlbEE2A-nVPFCg,I ordered from here and I was a little skeptical. But the food came fast it was fresh and delicious plus the driver was very pleasant. The prices are very fair 2 pizzas for 20 bucks with delivery and 24 hour service. Cant beat it. I will definitely order from here time and time again.,
13,agRhsgwSXbfGLupLaFtKYw,"We were out of town on a business trip and looking for somewhere local but not too pricy to eat. We found a flyer for this place in the door of our hotel room so we decided to give it a shot. The inside of the place is a total dump but don't let that fool you! We ordered three pizzas, two pepperoni and one meat lovers. Also I had the turkey sandwich. The pizza was fantastic!!! The crust is thin crust but it's yummy! The cheese and pepperoni are really yummy too! Good quality cheese. The meat lovers was amazing too! The turkey sandwich was pretty good the only thing I didn't like was that I didn't know it came with onions (the menu only says it comes with cheese) and I don't really like onions but what ever because after I bit into one I just took them off. Overall would highly recommend this place if you're in Vegas and looking for a good pizza place or a mom and pop restaurant to support.

P.s. The prices are fair too it was $20 for a medium pepperoni and a turkey sandwich","(fantastic, pizza)"
14,tPZV7u5XRjoYCX4g6Vv_Ig,"I ordered 2 xl pizzas, the Mama Mia and the grilled garlic chicken. They were incredible. I ordered them earlier in the morning to be ready at 11:30 for lunch. When I walked in a few minutes before 11:30 they were just coming out of the oven. They were hot and fresh. Great service. Everyone on my crew loved the pizza. I will definitely be back","(incredible, mamma mia pizza), (incredible, grilled garlic chicken pizza), (hot and fresh, mamma mia pizza), (hot and fresh, grilled chicken garlic pizza)"
15,x8Y3xBNxXBWbAg0HbsRzug,"I think that's the greasiest pizza I have ever had. It was dripping everywhere on us while we were trying to eat it. And $14 for two pieces of pizza and a soda is a little high, although they were big slices. Stood waiting for a few minutes with no other customers before someone helped me. She was very nice though.","(greasiest, pizza)"
16,tNL-6N8NnD96UgKo00uwvQ,"I used to like the pizza from here. Last time I ordered it was still doughy and I had to cook longer. Today it was ice cold. Not even lukewarm. My kid was screaming for pizza so I didn't send it back. But, I won't ever order from here again. $31 plus tip for a cold pizza and cold soup. There was a piece of ""garlic bred"". It was half a sub roll uncooked with some garlic butter on it. Yum. Should have had a can of Progresso and a frozen pizza and saved $25. Wait, I could have saved $35. I tipped $10. I figure a poor kid driving his own car deserves a decent tip. I called to let them know and she said sorry we can replace the pizza. My kid ate the cold thing anyway. And who wants to wait another hour for the replacement? Blah. Next time I'll drive my lazy self over to Bonnanos and pick up a pizza myself.","(doughy, pizza), (ice cold, pizza)"
17,In6LNuC2A5Kg8h9i_8w1HA,"Delicious pizza! I had the Lambretta special pizza, minus the prosciutto because I was in the mood for vegetarian (I'm sure it's delicious with the prosciutto too though). It was HUGE but it was thin crust and it was all I was having and I was hungry so I ate the whole thing myself!

The service was very fast and friendly, and the atmosphere and decor of the restaurant were very pleasant and modern. 

I will definitely come back here! The pizza was made from high quality, authentic ingredients, and I didn't feel stuffed in a bad way like I do at other pizza places. I felt great afterwards.","(delicious, pizza), (huge, pizza)"

Overall it was very good but still a bit over-priced due to the location. Plus it gets quite loud during lunch time.","(quite good, gnocchi)"

If you are looking for a REAL Italian family style restaurant, this is THE PLACE!!!
The setting is like being in Italy. You will love the atmosphere. Great experience.  

This is the best place we have been in Las Vegas. The service was perfect!! We made a reservation and had to queue only for 3 minutes, when the restaurant was flooded by customers arriving from everywhere. We had the pasta which is unique, a sublime pizza, an amazing tiramisù and cannoli (The list of pastries is delicious) and as we were really happy with the table we got, we decide to get an Italian red wine Chianti.

Excellent service, food and atmosphere. Thank you Ninni, Pasquale and Milena.
I wish you al the best!!","(sublime, pizza)"
21,PTJfN89_lUK2kI3rC_fh9w,Waited over two hours for my order. I called and they told me the order had left the shop and should be delivered any minute. After another 25mins I called back to cancel the order. What really upset me was they made no attempt to apologize and seemed bothered by the fact I called to check on my order. Probably wouldn't have been so upset if they wouldn't have charged my credit card. I love Antonios Pizza but I'll never use this location again.,
22,FdO7VqBbaLDUNCX9mQcc5g,"Waiter was over the top cheesy.  Talked too much.  A bit obnoxious.
No gluten-free options for pizza or pasta (Ferro's on St. Clair offers gluten-free options that are amazing - go there instead if you eat gluten-free).
One of the specials had risotto as a side so I asked if I could just have a small bowl of the risotto as my main and the waiter said no - didn't even go check with the kitchen - flat out no.  Treated me like I was asking them to make risotto from scratch.
So I ordered a steak instead which was good but if I wanted steak would have gone to the keg in the first place.
Marcello's is clearly stuck in the past....no variety for those with dietary restrictions.",

25,62121Ehxi45F7Bcb_w9BlQ,"We visited Pittsburgh last week for my 31st Birthday and booked Dish Osteria as our dinner spot. The restaurant is very cozy. Seating is limited, so I would suggest a reservation. The dinner menu changes daily, but overall, expect scrumptious seafood, pasta, and salad. First of all, the bread is delicious and fresh. We enjoyed snacking on it before receiving our antipasta  and salad. We ordered the Insalata Mista della Casa; the salad was the perfect blend of peppery and crisp greens. I would highly recommend ordering it. Both of the antipastas we requested were the standouts of our meal. The Carpaccio di Manzo literally melted in your mouth. The beef was incredibly fresh and sliced to perfection, and the Reggiano was a nice touch. The cozze was the best bowl of mussels either of us have ever devoured  (and I make mussels regularly at home). The taste was somehow delicate and full of flavor simultaneously. I can not imagine a better way to start off your dinner than with these two dishes. By the time we ate our main courses, we were already drunk on the flavors Dish Osteria has to offer. I ordered the Spaghetti ai Frutti di Mare. All of the shellfish was fresh and cooked to perfection. The spaghetti was a firm al dente, which is exactly how I prefer it. Amazing dish. My husband ordered the Saltimbocca di Vitello. The meat was delicious, but somehow the least impressive part of the plate. The butter potato gnocchi was seriously Heavenly! The texture was like fluffy marshmallow, and the flavor - buttery goodness. If I could eat it every day, I would. The brussel's sprouts were sauteed well and incredibly flavorful. Overall, our dinner was an incredibly experience, and if we lived in Pittsburgh, Dish is a place we would dine at regularly. 
We will remember our dining experience at Dish Osteria for years to come. It was simply delicious, and the best restaurant we visited while in Pittsburgh.","(seriously heavenly, butter potato gnocchi)"

27,ehc2VCA0m6qxmeBPmvQcDA,"Came here on the 29th of March for the Lucky Gnocchi Night, which is basically all-you-can eat gnocchi in a variety of sauces.

There are specific seating times for this event - not sure of all of the times, but the dinnertime options were 5 or 7 p.m.

The gnocchi overall was decent, it was kind of hit or miss with some batches overcooked, or too cold, or just right. Our faves of the night were the bolognese, four cheese, and Pompeii (basic, crushed tomato sauce). The pesto one was quite good as well, but the butter sage was flavourless. Service was frequent, but they ran out of some flavours and returned with second rounds of previous flavours instead which I was kind of disappointed in. 

I probably won't return for the gnocchi event now that I've tried it, but may go back to try out their pizzas and other dishes.","(decent, gnocchi), (kind of hit or miss, gnocchi)"

Both salad & meals (Gnocchi Vodka & Chicken Florentine) were well cooked & seasoned. The Gnocchi was as close to NY Italian that I have found in AZ.

We arrived at around 5:30 on a Saturday and there was plenty of space - the tables were filling up when we were leaving though.  I love, love, love that it is very kid friendly while still having amazing grown up food.   They have a kids menu, crayons and a little play area in the corner with some toys and a chalkboard wall.  My girls both had the kids salami pizza and my only complaint would be that the salami was too spicy - we picked it off and they ate their cheese pizza happily.  My husband and I both had pizzas and they were very good - thin crispy crust and large portions.   Our waiter was very friendly and the food arrived hot and quickly.  We will definitely be back - maybe for a date night without the kids next time.","(very good, pizzas)"

I found this place through a best friend of mine and now frequent the establishment often. I love love love there pasta! Its cooked to perfection and there sauces are spot on! Pasta Giovanni is a fave but i also love the Alfredo and there pesto Alfredo - all of there sauces are on point! 

There is also Pizza and all the classic favs like lasagna and eggplant parm! They have great appetizers like Italian fried cheese and Calamari - believe it or not there fries are amazing!!!! Ever try fries with red sauce or pesto aoli ?  You should :))) they have killer huge salads as well - i love the tuna salad :) 

The service is awesome! Im a bar girl so i never sit in the dining room but the bar service is on point! Especially when Suzy is on Shift - she is friendly and funny and always glad you came :) not to mention how she cares about the little things like Halloween Napkins - that made my day brighter! 

Oh yeah! If your into clam chowder they serve it Fridays made from scratch and it is the BEST in the Valley! 

Why 4 stars and not 5... Well i don't like there bread. The bread tastes cheap and preservative like - its just not good. I would love if they stepped there game up and tried a better Italian or french bread - i would eat sandwiches then - which they offer quite a few of but the bread is so bad i will not do it as of now. 

Overall its awesome - and i love it here!!! :)))",

I got my own pan pizza, which saved my boyfriend who got his own pizza, from being violently ill for 3 days. Im still feeling the stomach pain, although not the terrible twisting of death i was the days before. I phoned to inform them of what happened and of course, just as i thought, the person i spoke too did not care or say anything worth anything. I explained how I didn't want anything, just that they should probably know. They proceeded to tell me that i would need to see a doctor to prove what happened. I honestly do not care nearly enough to pay $10 for a doctors note to prove this. I am just warning other people that this was by far the most painful sick i have ever been in my life. Violently awful and lasted for days now. Please beware...",
39,lnhtrFbG4TnB_teOF8p9ZA,"After a shopping trip to Ikea nearby, we settled for some Italian- American comfort food, excited by the idea that we could ""pig"" out on their all-you-can-eat salads and bread.

This is a casual family dining restaurant, reminiscent of Olive Garden for their menu options, minus the overall warmth and look of the place. Service is snappy, almost excessive, I had a feeling they wanted to take our orders as soon as possible and rush us out of there. We weren't even done looking at the menu and the waitress had come by three times asking if we were ready. Since it was only a bit past 5 pm, we informed her that we'd start with salad and would like to wait before ordering our main meals. Barely through our first plate of cesar salad, which by the way is a good mix of creamy and garlic-y, our pastas had arrived. We didn't want to send them back for our meals would get cold, but again I felt too great of an urgency on their behalf. The restaurant was half empty, it's not like they needed to turn tables that quickly.

I opted for the firecracker shrimp bowtie pasta which is a mix of sauteed shrimps, tossed vegetables and pasta in a primavera sauce. Great flavors, but very oily. my partner had a monstrous looking 16 layer lasagna, the pasta to filling ratio was off. I don't understand how anyone could eat 4 inches of stacked noodles.

The slices were enormous, covered in pepperoni and piping hot. I'm normally more of a thick crust fan, but the crispy thin crust here was on point.

They have like 4 different locations, I have tried  three of them, once again the word is consistency! Same perfect meal each time.
Even lunch or just a slice of pizza is as good as I have had anywhere.
On a funny note, they are a bit quirky with the items you can put on a slice of pizza. Doesn't make sense, but no big deal. I love this place.

The gnocchi was soft and delicious, it came with a trio of sauces, the pesto was by far my favorite. My son had the fettuccine and all but licked the bowl, and this boy's a pasta expert! The best part of the meal was the incredible tiramisu. Our server told us that the owner's dad makes it fresh every morning, and you could tell. It was creamy and so very rich and delicious.

The sauce was not on the thick side.  I had the pasta dinner with sausage and mushrooms and it was very very good. I have had the cheesecakes there and they are not home made but ok when you have a sweet tooth.  The deliveries are very quick. I went to the actual store and it was clean and I watched them prepare the food and they used gloves. They are always friendly and polite. The store is located off Lorain Road closer to the Fairview Bridge and Kamn's Corner area.  There is plenty of parking and you can bike there if you want.","(fresh, pizza)"

I'm from Chicago and appreciated having this nearby. Well I'm not sure what happened but the past three times in the last two months are unacceptable. Just bad. First visit -- watery spaghetti and meatballs. It was marginally ok ... I ate it. The garlic bread was ... Terrible, I could have made better with wonder bread and garlic salt which is basically what it was ... Second time, I waited in line and their computer system went down it was a Friday night and they had no clue what to do... I forgave them for this, it happens but they could have written down my order and made my pizza ... They were completing orders and had other customers they just decided to freak out and not take mine, how did people order pizza and pay before computers? I had cash too. Third time tonight is just unacceptable. I don't eat a lot of pizza or carbs, when k to it's a treat ... I just spent $35 for a take and bake pizza (it was not cooked) and eggplant Parmesan (which was surprisingly ok) but the garlic bread was also not cooked. When I say this stuff was not cooked I mean it was not cooked. I had to break out my toaster oven which I did not appreciate. Terrible. I guess I have to find a new place or stick with due forni even though they are not really a take out place, huge disappointment I was hungry... 3 strikes you are out.","(great, pizza), (great, pasta)"
50,aX2QuckHkJXeYJhehZMdHQ,"In the past, there were spans when I would order pizza WAY too often. Lately, I've been eating a lot healthier...though, I'm not made of stone.

Of the delivery pizza places, I like Pizza Hut the most. Their on-line ordering feature is extremely intuitive, allowing you to visually customize your exact order.

This particular location just so happens to be the one assigned to deliver to my location. In the short time I've lived here, I've always had pleasant experiences with the delivery people. They always seem to be happy, and are decently engaged. Also, they always seem to arrive early or on-time...which is kind of important.

All in all, the Via Linda Pizza Hut is a reliable choice for a decent pizza in my opinion.

If you're looking for a tasty break from the normal pizza, try a Thin Crust Chicken + Jalapeno...but be warned...I think Pizza Hut harvests some of these peppers from the center of the sun. Not ALL of them...but there are a few that make you sniffle something fierce.",

Not to mention that having such a variety of fish to choose from is a rarity. The mains (no sharing) we had a hearty fish stew,  grilled salmon and the special Spigola and- Sea Bream - wow, this isn't even a seafood restaurant. we were overwhelmed, the fish properly cooked - showing off the true flavour and proper texture of the fish - beautifully prepared.

Must endorse the San Danielle pizza - fresh mozzarella with parma ham, mmmm and do NOT forget to ask for the chili oil, it is the perfect compliment if you like a little bit of spice. The Diavola pizza with spicy salami is equally delicious. The crust here is right up there with Terroni and the prices are about the same if not a bit lower.

Would also endorse the spaghetti and meatballs, so so tender the meatballs fall apart with a fork and the pasta is perfectly cooked with fresh curls of parmesan all over the top.

We visted a few more times over the next few years and everything was so very good. Last night proved it will be the last time. A 16' pizza is now $20 or more. All the prices went up and we were told it is because of the minimum wage hike. They only have one size pizza. We ordered garlic knots they were not hot at all and sent them back. We asked for our pizza to be a little crispy and half of it ended up being burnt. We have always asked to be a little crispy and it always came out so good, not this time.  Ordered 6 wings $6.50 for 6 wings
 They were very good. We asked for 1 ranch dressing to dip our pizza crust in. We got charged .60c for a souffle cup. Nope that was it. So very dissatisfied overall. Service was mediocre.

But as a lover of Hawaiian pizza I can tell you that is very easy to make a 3-star Hawaiian pizza and exceedingly difficult to make a 5-star Hawaiian pizza.  The one here is it.

The dough was perfectly cooked and the tomato sauce was delicious. I assume this applies to all of their pizza too. But the pineapples were the perfect size of chunks, plentiful, and did not soak through the dough.  The ham was not thin slices or cold cut ham; but rather thick chunks of cured pork.  Add to that a dash of the chilli-olive oil that they bring to the table, and you've basically got the perfect Hawaiian pizza.  My dad had a different pizza with chicken and it also looked awesome (he said he loved it though I did not try it).

We were seated in the Pope room which is fun but little freaky. Pictures of the Pope all over with a head of the Pope on the middle of the table and the Pope chair. Strange but cool having the Pope watch you eat. 

We started off by having the Mozzarella Garlic bread which was really good, the Chopped Antipasto salad, and the Apple Gorgonzola salad. The salads were pretty good not great but I thought it had a little too much vinegar for my liking. 

We had the Margherita pizza with fresh mozzarella which I thought was very good, Chianti Braised Short Ribs where they gave us three huge ribs that were boneless and covered in gravy which was very tender and very good. We couldn't have ribs without Rosemary Potatoes (meat & potatoes kind of guy) and they were really tasty and cooked perfectly. To top it off we had the Macaroni Rosa that had macaroni (of course) with a creamy sauce and chicken, broccoli and peas. It was really good. We ate it all up and had very little leftovers so that tells you the food was pretty good. No one seemed to be holding back. 

We can't forget about desert so we had the Dolce Platter which included Tiramisu, Double Dark Chocolate cake, Cheese cake, and Apple Crostata. The deserts were fantastic. Really good and everyone enjoyed it. 

The service was right on. Filling up our water glasses, beer, wine, ice tea, and soft drinks. Food came out in a timely manner too. So I have no complaints about the service.

She then told us it would be 30 mins for a thin crust!? So we decided for an extra 15 mins we would stay with the deep dish.

I was nearly impossible to cut it with a knife! Not only hard but absolutely no flavor to it. We ended up just eating the filling out of our slice which was good. We both did not want any more!

I can't comment on the lunch rush, but I'd certainly recommend Mercatto for dinner.","(brilliant, gnocci), (solid, prosciutto pizza)"
